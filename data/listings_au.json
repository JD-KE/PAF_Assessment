From Kirribilli, you only need to walk 5 minutes further to visit Sydney Luna Park, or take a walk across the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge, taking you to the city in just under 30 minutes.  Also 10 minutes walk away is North Sydney CBD, a bustling business district offering supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, shopping malls, hair dressers, gyms, dry-cleaners... as well as the dry-cleaner located right next door to the apartment itself!","notes":"The great thing about my apartment is it's location, however being so close to the city means whisper quiet surrounds are not guaranteed. The road outside my apartment can get a little busy during peak periods such as the morning and evening commute. If you are particularly sensitive to noise, this is something you should consider when staying at mine. It can get very warm in Sydney during the summertime. Although I don't have full air-conditioning installed, I provide a portable air-conditioner for my summertime guests. For taller guests 6 foot and over, my bed might be a bit of a squeeze. For couples I recommend putting the taller person on the pulled-out section of the bed where at least there's no frame hindering the feet! ;)","transit":"Getting around is ridiculously easy from my place. Walk 5 minutes down the road for North Sydney Ferry wharf, 7 minutes to Milsons Point Train station, 10 minutes to North Sydney train station and bus stands.    From Milsons Point station, it's only one stop to the city. Should you want to explore a little more of the Northern side of Sydney, the bus stop right outside the apartment complex will take you to the suburbs of Neutral Bay and Cremorne, home of Australia's most beautiful independent cinema The Hayden Orpheum Picture palace; built in 1932 and restored to its amazing former Art Deco glory... for all you movie buffs out there, it's definitely worth a visit!","access":"Guests have access to the entire apartment - Make yourself at home! ^_^","interaction":"Although you might not see me in person, I'll be available for any questions or issues via mobile or Airbnb message!","house_rules":"Please use coasters for glasses, and use a tray or tea-towel if you're resting plates on any furniture that's not a table.

It’s a suburb many aspire to live in and once you’re there, there’s little reason to leave, with plenty of shops along Military Road, stunning scenery and even the iconic Taronga Zoo to keep you amused. Balmoral Beach offers a more relaxed atmosphere, with parks, swimming and beachside cafes. It’s tempting to stay at home and get lost in the harbour view from your balcony, but at some point it’s important to leave the house. A walk through Mosman is an excellent workout due to the inevitable hill-climbing challenges. There’s a community bus for short trips and plenty of buses into the CBD; or the ferry if you prefer a water crossing. Small clumps of village shops include delicatessens, bakeries and specialty gift stores, while the major shopping precinct is located on Military Road.","notes":"Bookings made via AirBNB are subject to the standard booking terms and conditions displayed on the Luxico Holiday Homes website.

It's a relatively quiet beach where locals spend hours bathing in the sun. There is a park here with BBQs, toilets, changing rooms and a large grassy area to make a picnic. GREAT OCEAN WALK While you're in the area, you must take the Great Ocean Walk. It's a pathway that hugs the coast line all the way from Bondi to Coogee beach. Thankfully, it crosses your doorstep. Just join the throngs of people making the pilgrimage every day. SCULPTURES BY THE SEA Every year artists erect a series of sculptures along the Great Ocean Walk. It's a magical display set against the ocean views along the walk and it attracts thousands of local people and others from around the world. This year it is happening from 24 October - 10 November.","notes":"FREE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE We want you to have a great time when you stay at our place. We like the idea of you sitting out on the balcony celebrating something and admiring the view. So, anyone that books for 3 nights or more will find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in the fridge upon arrival. SAVING LIVES We are really thankful to live by the beach and it's a stunning beach. One of the things that makes this beach a great place to swim and have fun in summer are the lifesavers who volunteer their time to look after the people who use the beach. Chances are that you've chosen our place partly because of the beach out the front. So to thank the guys that look after the beach for us, 10% of everything that you pay to us will be given to them as a donation. It's the least we can do for the guys that keep the beach safe. We'll send you a copy of the receipt and any comments that we get from them in thanks.","transit":"BUSES The local area is serviced by buses that will take you to other transport hubs that will take you anywhere you need to go or you can catch a local bus directly to the CBD and be there in about 15 minutes. You'll have access to the internet from the computer set up for you in the apartment. Just either call 131500 and ask them for help or search 131500 on a search engine and you'll find a website showing all the timetables. You're not too far from anywhere!","access":"All guests will have free access to all the amenities and facilities in the Apartment. This includes a coffee machine, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, 434 litre fridge, a complete library of books, 54\" TV & DVD Player, wireless broadband internet, sound system and an intercom / security system. TRANSPORT Once you arrive at The BEACHFRONT Apartment you probably won't want to leave. But should the need arise, there is transport immediately out the front. The #361 bus stop is across the ride and it will take you to Bondi Junction or Bondi Beach. From the Junction you can catch buses and trains to the city.

We are lucky to have a selection of cafes for those times you just want to kick back and look at the view and recently a newly opened restaurant.  We have a local bowling club that also has a restaurant. The name Bundeena is an aboriginal word meaning “noise like thunder” and when you hear the waves lap up against the white sand its easy to understand why. On Bundeena's southern edge, footsteps of the people who walked before us echo across the land. On the beach and in the bush, there’s hidden evidence of a life well-lived… you simply need to know where to look.

Day passes are available from the local newsagent or petrol station, or if you are going to an area that has a ticket machine, you can buy a day ticket there. Day tickets cost $12. A delightful 20 minute ferry ride to Cronulla will give you a great view of the surrounding area and is a lovely start to a trip to Cronulla (or take the train to Sydney for the day).

This means once you have booked your payment is not refundable upon cancellation. Once we confirm your booking request there is no refund if you change your mind or book other accommodation. There will always be a time lag between when you make your booking request and when it is accepted and confirmed - sometimes this is minuscule and we deal with your request almost instantaneously; other times, for other reasons, it may take considerably longer to get back to you.

Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1.

You are also welcome to use the kitchen in the main house. It has an older gas stove which works well, but needs to be lit by hand. Guests who have experience with this type of stove are welcome to use it. As well as the gas stove, the main kitchen has a microwave and a fridge. Washing up is by hand. You also can share the house's verandah that can be sunny or shaded by means of a retractable awning. The verandah can be used for relaxing as well as eating meals. You will need to have footwear on the verandah as its surface is a little rough (but it meets safety standards and is still a lovely spot). Meals can also be eaten in the kitchen/living area that looks out onto the verandah and garden.  Happy to put on a load of washing for you washing every 3-4 days. I'll want you to peg it on the line, if that's okay. Drying is by means of pegging on a clothesline (it seems like the right thing to do in this warm dry country).","interaction":"I am often at home working on report writing.

If minor damage occurs, could you let me know? I will be kind review wise if you tell me about the damage and we discuss what should be done. It is a quiet neighbourhood, so I would want you to keep the noise to normal suburban home levels when outside the cabin. However, if the door is shut and the windows are only open a little, you can  make noise in the cabin and it will be fine.  I do not want any parties. I accept smoking outside provided no-one else who is present is uncomfortable with it. I have had smokers stay and they have used my outdoor seats and the verandah and that has been fine. Note that it could be cold out there at night, particularly in June, July and August. Also, be careful not to put any item over, or within 30 cm of, the heater. Otherwise, there is a risk of fire.

Because it's a harbourside suburb, and this is Sydney,  the terrain is hilly and quite steep in parts and the views are breathtaking.    The suburb has wonderful urban, green, pretension-free, harbourside vibe.  It's a great place for hiking.  If golf's your thing, there's  a public golf course just up the road.  An absolute must see is the iconic Greenwich baths, one of the few remaining Sydney Harbour public swimming baths.    It you love to work your muscles, there are many parks with outdoor training facilities (the best is at the bottom of my garden),  tennis courts for hire, an aquatic centre in Lane Cove, all this with great transport links to the CBD for the business traveller.  What's not to like?  There's a reason that most who move to Greenwich tend to trade up and stay in the vicinity rather than moves to other parts of Sydney.","notes":"SECURITY - HOUSE ALARM AND VIDEO/AUDIO SURVEILLANCE Alarm: The interior of the property is fitted with a back to base monitored alarm system.  Instructions for the operation of this system are included in both the House Manual and the Arrival Directions. It is extremely simple.

Exterior Surveillance:  There are 3 cameras covering the exterior of the property and 1 within the non-guest area of the property which record video and audio and store and upload to the cloud in real time. Note that tampering or removing these cameras will not prevent the information already recorded from being transmitted and stored.   The actual location of all exterior cameras will be shown to you at check-in. There is no surveillance inside the listing nor in the backyard/pool area.  These cameras feature a two way audio feed, so I can speak to you, and you me via them if necessary.

With so much choice it gets confusing,  so I advise guests to download any of the many local public transport apps to use during their stay.

Book early to secure your accommodation because we are often booked out during this period. Sydney is a bustling city and we're located right in the heart of it (which is part of the reasons why we love it!) so noise is inevitable.

This pad accommodates 4 adults comfortably but a max of 6 overnight. Any more than 4 adult guests overnight or extra sofa will attract an extra AU$30 per night, per additional guest. The sleeping arrangement for the 5th to 6th adult would be on a 2-seater sofa bed which folds out to a double with extra quilt","transit":"2 minutes walk to Central train station and bus interchange this apartment is perfectly located to get around Sydney.

If you’re looking for a beach holiday without sacrificing proximity to the city, This may be your best choice of Sydney accommodation. The beach stretches 1.8 kilometres, offering plenty of space for both locals and holidaymakers. This gorgeous shoreline is a mecca for couples and families alike with shower facilities, barbecues, a childrens' playground and terrific surfing conditions. The Dee Why SLSC patrol the beach each day. A fantastic bushwalk over the headland provides some sweeping views across the Tasman. If you need a break from the beach sun, head across the street and grab a table at any one of the many local restaurants or cafés with a great view of the surf instead. The beach’s promenade is also a fantastic place for a walk in the evenings.","notes":"The flat is best suited to a single or a couple, but within the flat there is a small, somewhat scruffy back storage room with a built-in single bed (listed here as 'bedroom 2', for lack of a better description).

Cafes  It is hard to have a bad cafe experience in Erskineville/Alexandria (let us know if you do). The possibilities are nearly endless and we have only explored a fraction ourselves. These are our regulars: Ella Guru, 104A Swanson St, Erskineville NSW 2043 Closest cafe - very friendly and good value. Toasted sandwiches a great quick lunch. Meet Gerard,  54 Henderson Rd, Alexandria NSW 2015 Further to walk but our favourite by far. Excellent coffee and delicious breakfasts, cakes and sandwiches. If you need to get a train from Redfern Station (e.g. to go to Bondi Junction) then this is a good place to fuel up on caffeine on your walk to the station. Restaurants Again you’ll struggle to find a bad meal. There are a small number of restaurants along Erskineville Road which are all pretty good and if you venture to King Street...well you can have just about anything.  Here are the local places that draw us back agai","notes":"Here are few things to be aware of: In most parts of Sydney - especially in summer - it is almost impossible to live completely free of bugs like mosquitoes and cockroaches. We have the house professionally cleaned before your stay and use repellents. However, since the weather suits having the windows and doors open, it is very difficult to completely rid a house of them. We have left some repellent, spray and mosquito coils but otherwise, we hope they don’t disrupt your stay. Sydney can get very hot in the summer months. By keeping blinds down during the day (including the lightwell in the kitchen), and running the fan and leaving windows open at night, it usually stays a very pleasant temperature. There is aircon in the upstairs bedroom if you need it. Unfortunately some years we get a string of super hot days. We do hope the temperature is pleasant for you. This is our home most of the year, so some things might be a little different to professionally run accommodation. We hope tha","transit":"Getting there:  5 Ada Street is a short taxi or Uber ride from the airport. We are also a 5 minute walk from Erskineville Station. However, the airport train is about $18 one way (depending on times), so for two people it is often a similar price to take an Uber/taxi, unless you are in the middle of peak hour (around 7:30-9am or 4:30-6:30pm) when traffic is very heavy. Public transport:  There a several train stations at a short walking distance: Erskineville (5 mins), MacDonald Town (10 mins), Newtown (10 mins) and Redfern (20 mins). From Erskineville Station you can take a train directly to Circular Quay and the harbour. You can also take the train to Central (two stops), which has connections to the airport. We encourage you to get an Opal card from a newsagent of seven eleven (there is one just past the station on Erskineville road). This is a pre-paid card that is necessary for many trains and busses and can be used on all public transport including ferries (check fares here (Webs","access":"We offer our entire home while we are out of town so there are no off limit areas.

It was originally a grand Victorian Terrace and had been divided into 5 flats with shared bathrooms.  I embarked on a full renovation with my builder and later employer Michael Wagstaffe which included building another level on top where I now live. I decided to trial Airbnb in mid 2017 in the smallest apartment which has been very successful. In December 2017 apartment 5 became vacant so I upgraded  it for Airbnb to be ready for NYE. I   have installed double glazing and acoustic flooring to make my guests stay as comfortable as possible.  My building is in  vibrant Surry Hills so you can step out the door and find restaurants and bars a plenty than come back to peace and quiet. I try to give the best service possible to my guests.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Surry Hills","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":3,"host_total_listings_count":3,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Surry Hills, NSW, Australia","suburb":"Surry Hills","government_area":"Sydney","market":"Sydney","country":"Australia","country_code":"AU","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.21718,-33.88653],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":6,"availability_60":7,"availability_90":28,"availability_365":32},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":99},"min_nights":2,"max_nights":31}

Daytime brings a buzzing cafe scene, with locals heading to Macleay Street for bistro brunches and edgy fashion. On Sundays, Kings Cross Market is filled with craft vendors and food stalls. Nearby, Llankelly Place is a foodie hub of hip multicultural eateries, while Victoria Street has backpacker pubs amid terraced houses. It sits on a ridge immediately east of Woolloomooloo, west of Elizabeth Bay and Rushcutters Bay and north of Darlinghurst.

There are lots of parks and recreation areas nearby as well as being near a popular local shopping centre which has a food court and coffee shops in addition to a number of busy cafes and restaurants nearby. The popular Norton Street Palace cinema complex is about 15 minutes brisk walk or 5 minutes on the nearby buses both at rear and in front of the Market Place centre, and that location also has its own Norton Street shopping centre, wifi, cafes, coffee shops and pubs.","notes":"As we have unlimited wifi here at our property you should find it easy to keep up with all your ongoing matters.

If going in to the centre of Sydney city, I prefer the light rail which finishes at Central station to change to other trains or buses depending on destination.  I will explain this more fully to any guests who have particular destinations in mind.  Suffice it to say, for now, that it is very very convenient and easy.  There is also access to plenty of Government buses which will take you to many locations....I just happen to really like trains!  At the nearby shopping centre there is a pick up drop off area for ‘Go Get’ cars, which can be very handy if guests would like to drive occasionally.  Registration and booking is all done on the ‘Go Get’ (Website hidden by Airbnb) (Hidden by Airbnb) will oblige.

Always available by phone, text and email.  I also love my country and have been to lots of places, so am always ready to suggest places to go or things to do if guests ask.","house_rules":"If bringing an infant please advise if you wish me to arrange hire of cot and/or high chair. I only approve a small dog as an accompanying pet and require to be advised of full details before confirming a booking.  For the 2 bedroom apartment dogs are not allowed beyond the rear patio and kitchen area...i.e. not on timber floors where their feet scratch.  There is a very large tiled kitchen/sitting room and tiled deck with direct access to the large rear courtyard area, so doggies are usually quite happy with that I find. Please deposit rubbish in outside bins before leaving and wash all kitchen items which have been used.   If a pet has been agreed to accompany you please ensure that all waste is picked up in a plastic bag, secured, and deposited in red bin. When leaving the unit, please ensure that lights, aircon and heating are switched off.

Take a mask and snorkel and walk to the next beach, Clovelly Beach, to see the protected Blue Gropers or a boogie board to the surf beaches, Coogee, Tamarama and of course, Bondi.  Our street is quiet, even when the beach is very busy on hot days.","notes":"It is located around the corner from Three Blue Ducks, a casual cafe and restaurant opened by three surfer friends that is featured in the 2014 Good Food Guide as one of the best cafe and restaurants  in Sydney's eastern suburbs. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby too: Vietnamese, Italian, Seafood, macrobiotic, modern Australian and much more. Food allergies are catered for if you need gluten free or lactose free breakfast. We try to be sustainable and use recycled products and the garden is watered by a combination of water captured in rainwater tanks and town water. The garden is fertilised by organic compost produced in both compost bins and worm farms. We have Australian native stingless bees that are kept away from the studio that help pollinate the garden. This means that we don't use any pesticides in the garden as we don't want to harm the bees.","transit":"A 2 minute walk to the 440 bus that will deliver you into the city in 20 minutes or 10 mins to Bondi Junction where you can catch the train to the city.","access":"The studio has its own verdant garden of orchids, avocado trees, banana palms and passionfruit vines.

Its a very convenient neighbourhood, however its on a quiet street and close to cafés and restaurants.  The apartment is located an easy walk to the neighbourhoods of Newtown, Redfern and Chinatown and walkable (2.5km) to Darling Harbour. For groceries, I recommend going to the SPAR supermarket at Redfern station.  This old Sydney neighbourhood is predominately made up of lovely old terraces but there are also many green spaces nearby.  There is a cafe is located just across the street, and there is a quiet boutique pub just next to it. There's also an organic tea shop just down the street too. Guests should try: * Going to the Harbour, I can suggest going for a walk across the bridge! You can also walk up a Harbour Bridge pylon (The South east one) for $13, or for something really special, book a bridgeclimb. Make sure you see the Opera House, and the entry to the Botannical Gardens is just behind it. *","notes":"You can use the space as you please however to comfortably accommodate 4 people, 2 would sleep upstairs and 2 downstairs in the living space on a convertible queen sized chaise sofa bed (Frieheiten Ikea sofa). The apartment is 64sqm in total including balconies. * The apartment has 2 toilets (one upstairs and one downstairs in the laundry), but just one shower (at the upstairs bedroom).  * I have a hairdryer, a rice cooker and even a baby cot! * Full kitchen use is included. Milk is provided and some sauces, butter etc. Note you are completely welcome to consume any food you find in the apartment. Tea and coffee is provided. * The complex has lots of fire extinguishers should you need them. * An early check in/late check out maybe available. Let me know in advance if you would like this option and I will check if it's possible for you. An extremely early checkin may attract an extra night's accommodation charge since it makes it difficult to rent the apartment out for the night before.","transit":"For your convenience I provide Opal cards (transport cards) for your use while in Sydney. If you use them I just ask that you top the cards up again to a balance similar to how you found them before you depart from Sydney.  The best way to from the airport to the apartment is to take a taxi. You are likely to get change back from $30. It's also just a 4 minute walk to Redfern station (which is 1 stop from Central), and you can be almost anywhere in the Sydney region pretty quickly.  You need to change trains at Central though. It should only take ~15 minutes and cost just under $30 for a taxi. (To go back to the airport I suggest hailing a taxi from the other side of Cleveland St outside the convenience store, taxis come very regularly.) There is a car share (GoGet) car 20 metres down the street, a bicycle hire cafe across the street and (some) buses nearby on Cleveland St.  And... the apartment has a car space too. :) If you are very keen, you can walk the whole distance through the c","access":"Easy check in procedure - if you want to arrive 11pm?

You will be near the harbour and in an entertainment area, therefore there is some noise from traffic and people. When windows and doors are shut there is virtually no noise. However if you like to sleep with your window open there is traffic noise.People who are city dwellers and global travellers claim there is no noise.","notes":"I have a home office, and at times I am quite busy. Please don't think I am being unfriendly, if I am not talking to you, I am just working. I am also often out, attending meetings. I am always available if you have any questions or concerns.","transit":"You will have the benefit of easy access to public transport to any point in Sydney. You will need to purchase an Opal card (Sydney's touch-on, touch-off integrated ticketing solution) at any corner store, news agency or at the airport.  Once you do, Sydney (and NSW) are all accessible. If you are flying into Sydney Airport, your room is a 21-24 min train ride (running every 6 mins during peak hours) and an easy 7 min walk away.  If you want to lap up the sun at Bondi, you'll be a 45 min bus ride away.  Taronga Zoo is a pleasant stroll to Circular Quay and a 12 min ferry ride away.  These are just some examples, but hopefully you get the idea!","access":"There is no cooking other than using the toaster for your toast each morning.  Cold water is on hand at all times.

It has a great community atmosphere and it's hard to walk down the street to the beach without running into people we know. We know and love lots of the cafe and restaurant owners in the area, and have made friends with lots of the neighbours.  The beach is the highlight of the area, and it's right across the street! Maroubra beach is 1km long and is popular for surfing, swimming, a BBQ, a nice spot to sit and have lunch/dinner or just a walk to get some fresh air, space and relax. It's less crowded than its neighbour up in Bondi, but no less beautiful. To the south end there is a reserve with no buildings or houses, so it's particularly beautiful looking down the sand and waves to the trees and headland. Maroubra has plenty of cafes and there are several great options for a morning coffee or brunch/lunch.

Happy to have a chat, discuss your travel plans and answer all the little questions that make a trip more enjoyable.  Interaction all depends on each others' needs at the time. Sometimes my guests come and go with not more than a quick hello and goodbye. They're busy, have limited time and lots to do. I'm not offended by this.  Other times I find myself sharing meals with guests, going out for coffee or visiting tourist attractions. There is no rule for how much interaction we have or don't have.","house_rules":"No smoking, pets, random guests or drugs you can't take through airports. Keep the kitchen clean and please don't keep food in the bedroom. There is plenty of space in the kitchen to store food. Treat my apartment, the building and my neighbours with the same courtesy you treat your own. I work full-time so check-in is typically after 6:00pm. This is flexible for weekends and public holidays so please discuss it with me prior to booking.","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","bed_type":"Real Bed","cancellation_policy":"flexible","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-07T05:00:00Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-07T05:00:00Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2013-01-04T05:00:00Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-01-28T05:00:00Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"number_of_reviews":65,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.5"},"amenities":["TV","Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Elevator","Buzzer/wireless intercom","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Essentials","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Hot water","Microwave","Refrigerator","Dishes and silverware","Cooking basics","Oven","Stove","Flat path to front door","Well-lit path to entrance","Host greets you"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"95.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"250.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"25.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"1"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/73594955/a7fd8b3d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"4116417","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4116417","host_name":"Gavin","host_location":"Surry Hills, New South Wales, Australia","host_about":"Born and raised in the suburbs of southern Sydney I've lived here all my life.

On Saturday visit Glebe Markets on the grounds of Glebe Public School.  'The Glebe' was given to the church by the Governour in the first few years of European settlement as a means for the church to support itself.  Most of the suburb was sub-dived and built upon in the 1880's and the vast majority of the terraces you'll see today were built in that era. Workers unions and left wing politicians managed to fend off building developers in the 1970's resulting in charming terraced townhouses and cottages surviving so close the the city skyscrapers.","notes":"*The house can accommodate up to 5 adults and two babies.
